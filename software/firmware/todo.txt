- peek eeprom ?


- ramp seems to be too steep inbetween (gamma correct)
- check protocol error every now and then.
- dithering ? Better low value color.

+ new sequence start: don't blend over from the last element, but from either
  the current color (best) or black.
+ get current sequence.
+ set aux.
+ proper frequency (almost there, need to fine tune)
/ store current sequence in eeprom after some time ? Round robin
+ if there was a usb-receive: increment the pwm counter roughly towards the right value to reduce flicker. Can we use the clock counter ?
+ setting sequence beyond given range.
+ white-balance: in eeprom ? (no hardcoded; 90% blue)
+ limit current
+ bug: conversion
+ new sequence starts right away
+ implement: get current color
+ serial number: in eeprom ?
+ store current limit flag in eeprom ?)



-- production test
- can we set the serial number ?
- Is the current limited correctly ?
- debug enabled off.
